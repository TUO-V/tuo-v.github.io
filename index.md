Eukaryotic Translation

1. Translation is the synthesis of a _protein_ from _mRNA_.

2. What RNA molecule will be used for transferring amino acids to a growing polypeptide?

_tRNA molecule will be used for transferring amino acids to a growing polypeptide._

3. Each tRNA has a specific amino acid at one end and at the other end is a three nucleotide sequence known as a(n) _nucleotide triplet_.

4. Which organelles are the site of polypeptide synthesis?

_Ribosome is the site of polypeptide synthesis_

5. rRNA is a component of ribosomes. In which organelle is rRNA produced?

_rRNA is produced in nucleolus._

6. In addition to rRNA, what else are ribosomes made of?

_Ribosomes are also made of proteins._

7. What is the start codon for translation?

_AUG is the start codon for translation._

8. Define "wobble"

_Even if the third base pair in a codon is incorrect, the correct protein will still be synthesized._

9. What are the termination signals for translation?

_UAA, UAG and UGA are the termination signals for translation._

10. After the newly synthesized polypeptide is released it undergoes formation of its three-dimensional shape. What are the two steps after a polypeptide is made to form its 3D shape?


11. The cytosolic process whereby a strand of messenger RNA dictates the amino acids that will be incorporated into protein is called

1) translocation			2) transpiration		3) transfusion		_4) translation_

12. Which of the following statements about translation is INCORRECT?

1) All three types of RNA (messenger, transfer, and ribosomal) are involved in translation.
2) A strand of mRNA dictates the amino acids that will be incorporated into protein. 
3) _rRNAs carry the amino acids to the mRNA strand._
4) The mRNA has codons which form base pairs with the anticodons on the tRNA.

13. All of the following are steps involved in protein synthesis EXCEPT

1) transcription		2) initiation		_3) replication_		4) elongation		5) translation

14. The end products of translation are

1) DNA			2) RNA			3) lipids			_4) amino acids_			5) polypeptides

15. Which of the following does NOT participate in transcription or translation?

1) DNA			2) mRNA			3) tRNA			4) rRNA		_5) DNA polymerase_

16. The two main processes linking gene to protein are

1) elongation and termination					2) initiation and transcription
3) _transcription and translation_				4) termination and translation

17. During translation, the initiation complex is composed of

1) an RNA polymerase, a DNA molecule, and accessory proteins
2) _an mRNA, a tRNA molecule, and two ribosomal subunits_
3) a DNA polymerase, an mRNA molecule, and a polypeptide chain
4) a tRNA molecule, an amino acid, and an anticodon

18. Which of the following are not paired correctly?

1) mRNA - carries the genetic information coded for in the DNA to the ribosomes.
2) rRNA - interacts with the ribosomal protein and helps maintain the characteristic shape of the ribosome.
3) tRNA - inserts the amino acid specified by the codon on mRNA into the polypeptide chain.
4) _Transposable elements - DNA sequences that wrap around each other into clusters._

19. Which of the following features are present in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?

1) Nucleus
2) Endoplasmic reticulum
3) _Ribosomes_
4) Linear chromosomes made of DNA and protein

20. In eukaryotes, ribosomes

1) are composed of tRNA
2) exist in cytoplasm as one unit
3) form a complete unit in association with mRNA
4) _take part in DNA synthesis_
